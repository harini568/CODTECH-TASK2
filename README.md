This code represents the basic structure of a **personal portfolio** webpage. Here's a brief description and essential aspects of the code:

1.HTML Structure:
   - `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type as HTML5.
   - `<html lang="en">`: Specifies the language of the document as English.
   - `<head>`: Contains meta-information like character encoding, viewport settings, page title, and links to external CSS files.
     - Meta Tags: Ensures proper character encoding and responsive design on different devices.
     - `<link>`: Used to link external resources like fonts (Boxicons for icons) and CSS files (Swiper, custom styles).
   
2. CSS(Internal Style):
   - The `<style>` block contains custom styles applied to various HTML elements.
   - Example: `body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; background-color: #f4f4f4; color: #333; }` sets the background and text color.
   - Custom CSS helps you to style the portfolio and make it visually appealing.

 3.JavaScript(Internal Script):
   - The `<script>` block allows for custom interactions or functionality.
   - Example: `console.log("Hello, World!");` is a simple JavaScript message output to the console, but you can add more complex functionality, such as animations or interactivity, later.

4. Header Section:
   - Contains the navigation links for the portfolio (`Home`, `About`, `Portfolio`, `Contact`) and the logo.
   - Icons for dark mode and mobile menu toggle are added for user interaction (using Boxicons).
